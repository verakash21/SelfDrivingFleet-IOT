		FROM 'scalable/telemetry' 
		WHERE 
		  fuel_level < 25
		13. Click Create rule.
J. Run the code

		1. In the Cloud9 terminal, start car1 by executing the following commands.
			cd ~/environment/car1
			node pub-sub.js
			
K. Communicate between two cars:

		1. Install the AWS IoT Device SDK for Python
			sudo pip install AWSIoTPythonSDK
		2. Download the application code in project folder by running the following commands in your AWS Cloud9 terminal for all cars
		cd ~/environment/car<number>
		wget https://github.com/verakash21/SelfDrivingFleet-IOT/blob/master/communicate.py
		3. For each car folder change topic name at line:143 in communicate.py 
		 Ex: Change myAWSIoTMQTTClient.subscribe(dev1Topic, 1, onMessageCallback) to myAWSIoTMQTTClient.subscribe(dev2Topic, 1, onMessageCallback) for creating car2 communication file
		4. Start the code for each car in different terminals:
		cd ~/environment/car<number>
		python communicate.py
		5. Use command in command.txt file to test communication.
		Remember: '|'  seperates the message and the last part is the sender where you have to run command whereas the middle part is the car that receives the message.
		L.	Using SQS for communication between multiple instances	
		1.	In AWS Management console, click IAM. In IAM, click on users.
		2.	Select your username and click on Add Permissions in the permissions tab. Click on ‘Attach existing policies directly’. Search for SQS and select ‘AmazonSQSFullAccess’. 
		3.	Go to your Cloud 9 IDE and add create_queue.py, send_message_queue.py and receive.py files to each car folder. GO to car car1 folder with the following command – cd ~/environment/car1
		4.	 Run create_queue.py file with the following command – python2 create_queue.py. This command will create a stand queue which you can see in SQS console.
		5.	Run send_message_queue.py with the following command – python2 send_message_queue.py. This sends a message to the queue with 30 seconds delay.
		6.	Now on a second EC2 instance follow steps 1-3. 
		7.	Run receive.py file with the following command – python2 receive.py. You will be able to see the message printed at bottom of the terminal
